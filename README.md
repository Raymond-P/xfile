# xfile
a simple shell script to automate the creation of shell scripts. 

---

**Creating scripts in bash can get repetitive. 
If it is repetitive automate it.**

hence xfile "executable file", a simple raw way of creating executable shell files. 
simply use it in your terminal with the name of the file you want to create. 

>	\>./xfile.sh filename
>	
>	NO NEED TO ADD FILE EXTENSION
  
*this is not fool proof so use it at your own risk.*
